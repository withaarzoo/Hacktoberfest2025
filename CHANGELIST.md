# Fix: Contributor Cards Duplicate Info Issue

## Problem
The contributor cards were showing the same user info (name, bio, GitHub link) repeatedly for each component, making it messy and hard to read with more contributors.

## Root Cause
1. **Data Overriding**: The `updateCardWithGithubData` function was overriding original contributor data from JSON with GitHub API data
2. **Duplicate Entries**: The contributors.json file contained duplicate GitHub profile URLs
3. **Limited Search**: Search functionality only worked on usernames
4. **Visual Sameness**: All cards looked identical without visual variety

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Preserve Original Data ✅
- Modified `updateCardWithGithubData()` to **preserve** original contributor names and bios from JSON
- Only update GitHub-specific data (avatar, stats) while keeping contributor-provided information
- Store original data in `dataset` attributes for reference

### 2. Duplicate Detection & Filtering ✅
- Added `filterAndValidateContributors()` function to remove duplicate entries
- Track seen GitHub usernames to prevent duplicate cards
- Validate required fields (name, bio, github_profile_url) before display
- Log duplicate removal for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Bio Information ✅
- Include occupation and place information in bio display
- Format as: `bio • occupation • place` for richer content
- Better utilization of available contributor data

### 4. Improved Search Functionality ✅
- Search now includes username, name, AND bio content
- More comprehensive filtering for better user experience
- Search across all contributor-provided information

### 5. Visual Card Variety ✅
- Added alternating border styles for visual distinction
- Gradient border effects using CSS pseudo-elements
- Bio separator lines with accent color
- Better spacing and typography

### 6. Error Handling ✅
- Graceful handling of failed GitHub API calls
- Preserve original data when API requests fail
- Show "N/A" for stats instead of error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Technical Changes

### JavaScript (js/main.js)
- `filterAndValidateContributors()`: New function for data validation
- `createPlaceholderCard()`: Enhanced with occupation/place data
- `updateCardWithGithubData()`: Preserves original contributor data
- `filterContributors()`: Improved search across multiple fields

### CSS (css/style.css)
- Added gradient border effects for card variety
- Improved bio display with visual separators
- Fixed CSS linting issues (line-clamp compatibility)
- Enhanced visual hierarchy and spacing

## Results
- ✅ Each contributor card now displays unique, accurate information
- ✅ No more duplicate or overwritten contributor data
- ✅ Better visual distinction between cards
- ✅ Enhanced search functionality
- ✅ Preserved contributor-provided information
- ✅ Improved readability and user experience

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
- Duplicate contributors are filtered out
- Original contributor data is preserved
- GitHub API data enhances but doesn't override
- Search works across multiple fields
- Visual improvements enhance readability
